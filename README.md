This program searches through long form text (ie novels) for use of 
possesive pronouns (ie his, her, their). When it finds one it tries
to work out whether it's a body part that's being owned. If it is
a body part then the program records that against the pronoun. 

Once a full count is complete the program does some basic analysis
of the numbers and then presents summaries of it's findings.

The user has the option to export all data to a database, allowing
in depth and intertextual analysis via SQL.

If you use this program in your research, please let me know!
Information about correct referencing can be found in the 'About'
panel. 

If you want to edit the code, and anything isn't clear here, there's a
map of the code in the documentation.
